# Jardin del CSS

Back in the day, one of the most exciting but simple projects in the ecosystem was [CSS Zen Garden](https://csszengarden.com/). I want to create something similar but in spanish with some tweaks.

* CSS3 is allowed and encouraged
* Support for IE9+ is optional
* Use only CSS features with a global usage of 90% or superior of all users according to [CanIUse](https://caniuse.com/)
* Don't translate this to english it should be in spanish
* Try to follow the best techniques and tips for performance and web accesibility
